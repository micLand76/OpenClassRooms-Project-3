Design a Python app adapted to the need of Lean@Home

Learn@Home wants to help students with tutors.
* They need a platform where they can communicate and use a calendar with tasks and events.
* It might be useful for the students and the tutors and be secure.

It will be 5 pages:
* Authentification page (with a page to create a new count and a page for who forgot his password)

* Tasks which displays the students and tutor tasks
* Calendar which displays events by date and where it's possible to create a new event
* Chat to manage messages between students and tutor

## Wireframes

## User Cases
After the wireframes, we made the user cases in P3_03_User Cases.pdf

## User Stories
